# Hourly Code Examples Generator

This repository automatically generates code examples in multiple programming languages every hour.

## How It Works

A GitHub Action runs every hour and creates new example files in:

- **Python** - Demonstrates algorithms, data structures, and utility functions
- **HTML** - Shows responsive design with CSS and JavaScript interactions
- **C** - Illustrates system programming, algorithms, and data structures

## Directory Structure

- `python_examples/` - Contains all generated Python examples
- `html_examples/` - Contains all generated HTML examples
- `c_examples/` - Contains all generated C examples

## Latest Generation

The most recent code examples were generated at: 2025-03-23 22:57:22 UTC

## Purpose

This repository serves as a demonstration of:

1. GitHub Actions for automated tasks
2. Working with multiple programming languages
3. Generating useful code examples automatically
4. Version control of programmatically created content

## Technologies Used

- GitHub Actions
- Bash scripting
- Python, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and C programming languages
